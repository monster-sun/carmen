move_group_random: randomly assign coordinate

move_group_coordinate: move to a predefined coordinate in space

move_group_coordinate2: subscribe to topic /point and then move to that coordinate in space.
rostopic pub point geometry_msgs/Point '{x: -0.687822, y: 0.316510, z: 0.475076}' --once

note: orientation w,x,y,z are currently predefind until I can figure out either:
	a) how to insert the right orientation figures into /point topic
	b) i can set a universal orientation figures

# Update:
Alternative to publishing topic:
rostopic pub /move_group/fake_controller_joint_states sensor_msgs/JointState '{header: {seq: 0, stamp: {secs: 0, nsecs: 0}, frame_id: ""}, name: ["art1"], position: [150.0], velocity: [0.0], effort: [0.0]}' --once

position: [1.2479490205621717, -0.6382032520635745, 0.25038124775567, -0.07965276236259244, -1.5680344280265524, 1.823960169093795]

Problem:
Using the above code and running Arduino Ros Serial Blink, the LED will blink. However when we publish 6 joints, it fail to blink. Maximum we could publish for the ros serial to blink is 3 joints
However, when I publish 1 joint with 6 float position with many decimal places, the blink works!
Problem is with the JointState.name! Try brazenbot_joints, I think you have to convert the JointState.name into char like specified here:
